# file dialouuge 
![file](images/file.png)
i made use of the "filedialouge" library which is part of tkinter to allow me to prompt the user where to save / open files 

## open 
![open](images/open.png) 
- prompts the user to be able to open previously written files or projects
- it opens the project in the current window

## save 
![save](images/save.png) 
- allows the user to save their work 

## close 
![close](images/close.png) 
- if the user hasnt saved the program will ask if the user wants to quit **without saving** 

# light mode 
![light](images/light.png)
- default mode is light mode but there is a button to allow the user to change it 

# dark mode 
![dark](images/dark.png)
- when the light mode button is pressed the theme changes to dark and can be pressed again to change back
